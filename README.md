# AI-smart-meter-advisor
AI Smart Meter Advisor is a web-based application that predicts electricity usage for the next 7 days using machine learning and provides actionable energy-saving tips. It is designed to help households and small businesses monitor consumption, identify peak usage days, and adopt efficient energy habits.

The app features an engaging neon-themed UI, interactive charts, and AI-powered advice per day.

🌟 Features

Historical Usage: View past electricity consumption in an interactive table.

7-Day Forecast: Predict daily electricity usage (kWh) using Random Forest regression.

Peak vs Normal Day Detection: Highlights days with higher-than-average usage.

AI Energy Tips: Each day comes with 3 practical, actionable tips generated by a Large Language Model (LLM).

Engaging UI: Neon-style design, interactive Plotly charts, and cards for key metrics.

Forecast Explanation: Friendly, concise paragraph summarizing the week's energy usage.

🚀 Installation & Setup

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/<username>/ai-smart-meter-advisor.git
cd ai-smart-meter-advisor


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Set HuggingFace API Token

Create a main.env file (if not already present) in the repo root:

HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_api_token


The app will load the token using Python’s os.environ.

Run the app locally

streamlit run app.py

📊 How it Works

Loads historical electricity usage data from energy_data.csv.

Calculates daily energy consumption in kWh and average usage.

Classifies days as Peak or Normal based on usage.

Trains a Random Forest model to predict energy consumption for the next 7 days.

Generates 3 AI-powered energy-saving tips per day using HuggingFace LLM.

Displays data, predictions, and advice in an interactive Streamlit dashboard.


💡 Usage Tips

Focus on Peak days: Reduce unnecessary loads and use energy-efficient appliances.

Follow daily AI tips for consistent energy savings.

Use historical insights to identify trends in your consumption.
